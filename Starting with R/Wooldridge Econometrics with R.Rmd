## Introducing the Pipe Operator

```{r, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
# allows us to comment
# loanapp data from wooldridge package
# ?loanapp
data (loanapp, package='wooldridge') 

mean(loanapp$price)

# pipe you should think about "then"
loanapp %>%
     summarize(avg_price=mean(price))

```

Observations with price less than average price

```{r, include=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
round(mean (loanapp[loanapp$price < mean(loanapp$price),]$price), digits=2)


loanapp %>%
  filter(price< mean(price)) %>%
  summarize(avg_price=mean(price)) %>%
  round(digits=2)


```
