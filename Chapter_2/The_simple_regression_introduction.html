### What is Regression?

- In statistics, regression is the practice of *line-fitting*

- We want to *use one variable to predict another*

- Let's say using `\(X\)` to predict `\(Y\)`

- We'd refer to `\(X\)` as the "independent variable", and `\(Y\)` as the "dependent variable" 

- **Regression is the idea that we should characterize the relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` as a *line*, and use that line to predict `\(Y\)`**

---

### `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

- Data for `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---

### `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
-  `\(X\)` is 2.5 and want to predict  `\(Y\)`. 

--

- If we look carefully there are multiple of values of `\(Y\)` for `\(X=2.5\)`. What would the predicted value of `\(Y\)` be? 

---

### `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`



![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

- What if we want to predict `\(Y\)` for a value we DON'T have any actual observations of, like `\(X = 4.3\)`?
---

### Data is Granular

- If we try to fit *every point*, we will get a mess that won't really tell us the relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

- So, we *simplify* the relationship into a *shape*: a line! The line smooths out those three points around `\(X=2.5\)` and fills in that gap around `\(X=4.3\)`.

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

###  Isn't This Worse?

- By adding a line, we are necessarily *simplifying* our presentation of the data. 

- Our prediction of the *data we have* will be less accurate than if we just make predictions point-by-point

- However, we'll do a better job predicting *other* data (avoiding "overfitting")

- And, since a *shape* is something we can interpret, as opposed to a long list of predictions, which we can't really, the line will do a better job of telling us about the *true underlying relationship*

---

###  The Line Does a Few Things:

- We can get a *prediction* of `\(Y\)` for a given value of `\(X\)` (If we follow `\(X = 2.5\)` up to our line we get `\(Y = 7.6\)`)

- We see the *relationship*: the line slopes up, telling us that "more `\(X\)` means more `\(Y\)` too!"

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;


---

###  Lines

- The line we get is the *fit* of our model

- A model "fit" means we've taken a *shape* (our line) and picked the one that best fits our data

- All forms of regression do this

- Ordinary Least Squares specifically uses a **straight line** as its shape

- The resulting line we get can also be written out as an actual line, i.e.

$$ Y = intercept + slope*X $$

---

### Lines

- We can use the *line* to plug in a value of `\(X\)` and get a prediction for `\(Y\)`

- Because these `\(Y\)` values are predictions, we'll give them a hat `\(\hat{Y}\)`

$$ Y = 3 + 4*X $$

$$ \hat{Y} = 3 + 4*(3.2) $$

$$ \hat{Y} = 15.8 $$

---
###  Lines

- The intercept is the prediction of `\(Y\)` when `\(X=0\)`

`$$Y = 3 + 4*X$$`
--

`$$\hat{Y} = 3 + 4*0$$`

`$$\hat{Y} = 3$$`

---

###Lines

- And as `\(X\)` increases, we know how much we expect `\(Y\)` to increase because of the slope

$$ Y = 3 + 4*X $$

$$ \hat{Y} = 3 + 4*3 = 15 $$
- How much does `\(Y\)` increases when we increase `\(X\)` by `\(1\)`?

--

$$ \hat{Y} = 3 + 4*4 = 19 $$
- In increase by the **slope** (which is `\(4\)` here)


---

### Ordinary Least Squares. Review


- Regression fits a *shape* to the data

- Ordinary least squares specifically fits a *straight line* to the data

- The straight line is described using an `\(intercept\)` and a `\(slope\)`

- When we plug an `\(X\)` into the line, we get a prediction for `\(Y\)`, which we call `\(\hat{Y}\)`

- When `\(X = 0\)`, we predict `\(\hat{Y} = intercept\)`

- When `\(X\)` increases by `\(1\)`, our prediction of `\(Y\)` increases by the `\(slope\)`

- If `\(slope &gt; 0\)`, `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are positively `\((+)\)` related/correlated

- If `\(slope &lt; 0\)`, `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` are negatively `\((-)\)` related/correlated


---

# Concept Checks

- How does producing a *line* let us use `\(X\)` to predict `\(Y\)`? 

--

- If our line is `\(Y = 5 - 2*X\)`, explain what the `\(-2\)` means in a sentence

--


- Not all of the points are exactly on the line, meaning some of our predictions will be wrong! Should we be concerned? Why or why not?

--

- We know that regression fits a line. But **how does it do that** exactly?


---

### Predictions and Residuals

- Whenever you make a prediction of any kind, you rarely get it *exactly right*

--

- The difference between your prediction and the actual data is the *residual*

$$ Y = 3 + 4*X $$

If we have a data point where `\(X = 4\)` and `\(Y = 18\)`, then

$$ \hat{Y} = 3 + 4*4 = 19 $$

Then the *residual* is `\(Y - \hat{Y} = 18 - 19 = -1\)`.

---

### Predictions and Residuals

Our relationship doesn't look like this...

$$ Y = intercept + slope*X $$
--

Instead, it's...

$$ Y = intercept + slope*X + residual $$

We still use `\(intercept + slope*X\)` to predict `\(Y\)` though, so this is also

$$ Y = \hat{Y} + residual $$

---

### Ordinary Least Squares

- A good prediction should make the residuals as small as possible


- We are going to *square* those residuals, so the really-big residuals count even more. We really don't want to have points that are super far away from the line!

- Then, we pick a line to minimize those squared residuals ("least squares")

---

### Ordinary Least Squares

- Start with our data

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

### Ordinary Least Squares

- Let's just pick a line at random, not necessarily from OLS

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---


### Ordinary Least Squares

- The vertical distance from point to line is the residual

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

###  Ordinary Least Squares

- Now square those residuals

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

### Ordinary Least Squares

- Can we get the total area in the squares smaller with a different line?

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

###  Ordinary Least Squares

- Ordinary Least Squares, I can promise you, gets it the smallest

![](The_simple_regression_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

###  Ordinary Least Squares

- How does it figure out which line makes the smallest squares?

- There's a mathematical formula for that!

- We will derive the formula in the next lecture

- Let's Play Now:
[**Guess the regression line- SIMULATION**](https://professoramanda.github.io/econsimulations/)

---

### Concept Checks

- If I have the below OLS-fitted line from a dataset of children:

$$ Height (Inches) = 18 + 2*Age$$

And we have the kids Darryl who is 10 years old and 40 inches tall, and Bijetri who is 9 years old and 37 inches tall, what are each of their: 

  -  predicted values
    
  -  residuals
    
  -  sum of their squared residuals

---

### Ordinary Least Squares in R

- Ordinary Least Squares is built in to R using the `lm` function

- Let's run a regression on the `Orange` data set of tree age and circumference


```r
data(Orange)
lm(circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)          age  
##     17.3997       0.1068
```

---


###  Ordinary Least Squares in R

- In this class, we'll be using `feols()` from the **fixest** package instead of `lm()`

- This doesn't make too much difference now, and the code looks the same so far, but this will help us easily connect to other stuff


```r
library(fixest)
feols(circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
```

```
## OLS estimation, Dep. Var.: circumference
## Observations: 35 
## Standard-errors: IID 
##             Estimate Std. Error  t value   Pr(&gt;|t|)    
## (Intercept) 17.39965   8.622660  2.01790 5.1793e-02 .  
## age          0.10677   0.008277 12.90023 1.9306e-14 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## RMSE: 23.0   Adj. R2: 0.829502
```

###  Ordinary Least Squares in R

- What's going on here?



- `circumference ~ age` is a *formula* object. It says to take the `circumference` variable is the dependent variable `\((Y)\)`. Have it vary (`~`) according to `age` (independent variable, `\(X\)`)

- `data = Orange` tells R in which  data set to look for those variables 

- The output shows the `(Intercept)` `\((\hat{\beta}_0)\)` as well as the slope `\((\hat{\beta}_1)\)` on `age` (why doesn't it just say `slope`? Because later we'll have more than one slope!)

---

### Ordinary Least Squares in R

- There's lots more information we can get from our regression, but that will wait for later

- For now, let's just make a nice graph of it using the **ggplot2** library (which you already got installed when you installed the **tidyverse**)


```r
library(tidyverse) # This loads ggplot2 as well
ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, y = circumference)) + 
  geom_point() + # Draw points
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') # add OLS line
```

---

###  Ordinary Least Squares in R

- The result:
